# innov8_chatbot

This project is a chatbot built using the Gemini 1.5 Flash Model API and FastAPI. 

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipak-chh12/innov8.git
   cd innov8

2. Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file (or use hello.env) with the necessary environment variables for your API configuration.


3. Run the Backend: Start the FastAPI server by running:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000.


4. Open the Frontend: Open index.html in your web browser to interact with the chatbot.



### Note
The project is not deployed because GitHub didn't allow non static website to be deployed. You can test the chatbot via local host using the steps above. Hope you have a good day.
Thanks and have fun with the chatbot✌️
